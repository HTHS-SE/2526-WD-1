                            <p class="card-text">Consumption is the largest factor of GDP, and it shows 
                                the total value of goods and services purchased by the people. 
                                Consumption is tracked because it is a strong indicator of financial 
                                stability for the avergae household. Strong markets drive up consumption, 
                                so tracking consumption over time plays a large part in GDP growth and 
                                decay. Data on consumption is collected from companies that sell products 
                                and services and compiled for the entire nation. Consumption, in its 
                                large role in the calculation of GDP, often is a deciding factor in a 
                                country's economic stability and future success.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Investment refers to businesses spending on goods used 
                                in production. This includes machinery, factories, and other technology 
                                used. Unlike financial investments stuch as the stock market, investment 
                                in terms of GDP is about physical capital. Investment is used to track 
                                businesses and households focus on future technology. Investment can show 
                                borrowing costs and interest rates, as companies are more likely to 
                                invest when it is cheaper. By analyzing the trends in investment, 
                                economists can understand the future growth  and economic potential of a
                                country through its domestic production.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Governmnet spending represents the government's 
                                consumption and investment. This includes government spending on defense, 
                                education, healthcare, government employees, infrastructure, and more. 
                                Federal, state, and local government budgets are compiled to calulate 
                                the total government spending. Government spending plays a large part in 
                                stabilizing a country's economy since it isn't affected by smaller 
                                economic fluctuations like consumption and investment are. Economists track 
                                government spending to identify how policies will affect the country's overall
                                economy, and how that might affect the people and the country's economy in 
                                the future.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Net exports measure the value of goods and services a 
                                country sells abroad (exports) minus the value of goods and services 
                                they buy from other countries (imports). This component reflects a 
                                country's international trade. Typically, countries aim to have higher 
                                exports than imports, boosting domestic industry and having a net 
                                positive exports. To calculate net export, data from customs and 
                                international accounts are compiled to calculate the exports and 
                                imports. Strong export growth for a country, especially when they have a 
                                monopoly in a certain industry, can boost their GDP significantly. 
                                Economists use exports to identify which countries are more competitive 
                                in global markets.</p>
