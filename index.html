                    Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a
                    country's borders in a specific time period. It serves as a comprehensive measure of a nation's overall
                    economic activity. America’s GDP has changed a lot over time, and America has become one of the world’s
                    strongest powers.

                    <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one of the main indicators used to measure a country’s economic health because it represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a nation over a specific period.<br><br>

When GDP grows, it usually means businesses are producing more, jobs are being created, and people have higher incomes, which are signs of a strong, healthy economy. On the other hand, when GDP falls or grows very slowly, it suggests reduced production, job losses, and lower consumer spending, showing economic weakness or even a recession.<br><br>

Rising GDP reflects economic expansion and prosperity, while declining GDP indicates economic stress. Therefore, GDP has many real-world uses for governments, businesses, and economists because it helps measure and compare economic performance.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The unemployment rate measures the percentage of people in the labor force who are not working but are in the process of looking for a job. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force. The labor force includes people who are employed or looking for work, excluding retirees, students, and discouraged workers. A high unemployment rate indicates economic weakness, while a low rate indicates economic strength but can lead to labor shortages. Unemployment can either be frictional, structural, cyclical, or seasonal, depending on the cause.</p>

It is a key indicator of inflation and is used by government programs to adjust payments and wages, as well as to analyze the real value of economic data after removing inflation. A rising CPI indicates increasing inflation, while a falling CPI indicates deflation.</p>

It is based on surveys that ask consumers about their current financial status and their future expectations. A high CCI indicates that consumers are confident and likely to spend money, which can lead to economic growth. On the other hand, a low CCI suggests that consumers are worried about the economy and may cut back on spending.</p>

Central banks like the Federal Reserve in the U.S. can adjust interest rates to monitor economic activity. Lowering interest rates can encourage borrowing and spending, while raising rates can help control inflation. Interest rates can affect various economic factors including consumer spending, business investment, and currency value.</p>
